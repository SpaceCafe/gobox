	// These types of errors should be fixed immediately but do not necessarily mean the program is failing.

	// FatalLevel logs indicate that an unrecoverable error has occurred and the application cannot proceed
	// with its current operation. The application will typically exit after logging a fatal message,
	// possibly with a non-zero status code to indicate failure.
	// For example, "Failed to start server", "Database connection lost".
	// These types of errors are usually indicative of serious problems that require immediate attention.
